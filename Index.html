                <h4>AI Assistants Are Quietly Replacing Routine Office Work</h4>
                <p>Artificial intelligence tools are no longer experimental toys. Email drafting, meeting summaries, customer support responses, and basic data analysis are increasingly handled by AI systems embedded in everyday software. Companies report higher productivity, but workers are now under pressure to adapt faster than ever.

Experts warn that while AI boosts efficiency, it also shifts skill requirements. Critical thinking, oversight, and creativity are becoming more valuable than repetitive execution.</p>
